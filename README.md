Fireworks Typing Effect
This project features an interactive typing effect that produces animated fireworks whenever a user types into an input field. The effect is achieved through JavaScript and CSS, creating colorful particles that simulate fireworks around the typed characters, adding a playful and visually appealing experience.

Files
index.html
Contains the basic HTML structure, including an input field where the user can type to trigger the fireworks effect. The HTML file links to the CSS for styling and the JavaScript file for handling the animation logic.

style.css
Provides the styling for the input field and the fireworks effect. It includes:

Responsive Font Sizing: Ensures that the font size adjusts based on screen width.
Particle Styling: Defines styles for the animated particles that appear with each keystroke, including size, shape, and position.
index.js
Contains the JavaScript logic for creating and animating the fireworks effect. Key elements include:

FireworkTyping Class: Listens for input events on the text field and generates particles when characters are typed.
Animation Logic: Particles are created with random colors, sizes, and motion paths to simulate fireworks. They disappear after completing their animation cycle, maintaining a clean display.
Usage
To use the typing effect:

Open index.html in a web browser.
Begin typing in the input field, and observe the fireworks effect around each character.
This project is an enjoyable way to add interactive, visually engaging animations to text input fields, perfect for creative applications or fun form designs.
